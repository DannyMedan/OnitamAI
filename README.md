# OnitamAI
### Introduction

Simple side project hopefully to practice coding, PyGame, DL and client/server architecture.

Currently, this project is a simple implementation of the Two-player board game Onitama, by designer Shimpei Sato. You can find more information about the (very excellent game) here:
https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160477/onitama

You can also watch this [how-to-play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFRewjcngwU "how-to-play") video if you're not really into reading (but then why are you here??).

Future plans for this project include:
- Try to develop a rival AI
- Integrate AlphaZero as the hard difficulty rival
- Implement online p2p play
- Make everything look less sh**ty

#### Dependencies

- PyGame

More dependencies will probably be added as I continue developing this project.
